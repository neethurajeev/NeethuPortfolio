        <p className="about-text">
          With over <strong>5 years of professional experience</strong> in both
          front-end and back-end development, I bring a full-stack perspective
          to every project I work on. I combine a strong eye for design with a
          deep understanding of modern web technologies to build responsive,
          user-focused websites and applications that are as functional as they
          are visually engaging.
        </p>

        <p className="about-text">
          Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety
          of projects, from small business websites to large-scale applications
          used by millions of users. I am passionate about web design and
          development, and I am always looking for new and innovative ways to
          improve the user experience.

        <p className="about-text">
          In my work, I strive to balance aesthetics with functionality, using
          the latest technologies and best practices to create interfaces that
          are both visually stunning and user-friendly. I believe that good
          design is not just about looking pretty, but about creating a seamless
          and intuitive user experience that keeps users coming back.
